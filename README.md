# Project Name

**Author**: Ediberto Ponce & Katy Roffe
**Version**: 0.0.1

## Overview

- In this app, I will be connecting our front-end React app to our back-end Express server. The Express server will connect to a Mongo database. We will need to make a “schema” in our back-end code to model how we want our data to look. We will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to our server, our server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Our front end will display these results.
