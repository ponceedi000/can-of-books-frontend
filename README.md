# Project Name

**Author**: Ediberto Ponce & Katy Roffe
**Version**: 0.0.1

## Overview

- In this app, I will be connecting our front-end React app to our back-end Express server. The Express server will connect to a Mongo database. We will need to make a “schema” in our back-end code to model how we want our data to look. We will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to our server, our server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Our front end will display these results.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

- JavaScript
- React
- Cors
- Dotenv
- Express

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - 8:00am – 10:00pm
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack
- How often will you take breaks?
  - Whenever needed but we’ll shoot for a minimum of at least once every two hours
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Identify our MVP’s and prioritize those accordingly. If need, we will bring in a TA for assistance.

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each person’s strengths.
  - Eddie: CSS and front-end JavaScript
  - Katy: CSS, and organization
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - Eddie will likely cover down on the front-end but help with back-end when needed.
  - Katy will likely cover down on back-end but help with front end when needed.
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - We’d both like to improve our JavaScript skills.
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - We will conduct the Driver & Navigator Pair Programming  method and ensure we approach each problem one step at a time.
  
### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - Speak up to our partners and if the issue persists, let an instructor know.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - Same as above.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Make efforts to communicate clearly and to help with any questions regarding our code. Come in with a healthy dose of patience and understanding.
